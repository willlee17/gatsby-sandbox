<!-- Notes -->

 - Ran into a bit of confusion on home page and the collections page from the Notion doc. So I just combined them into one. 
 - No docs about how subcollections (page that holds products of one type of collection) looks so I just made a simple one with product cards. 
 - Think there's probably a better way to use GatsbyImage from Contentful. I'm just pulling in 400px ones - should ask team what best practices are
 - I have two giant .createPages. Seems repetitve, should ask team what best practices are for this as well. 
 - General styling, font, margins, etc. improvements.
